they should drive attention

[11:54]  
and investment

[11:54]  
via ICOs

[11:54]  
this is the most robust partnership creator ive ever come across

[11:55]  
steem becomes a bandwidth / gas token for some of it

[11:55]  
and in some cases the tokens are additive, where both tokens act as rewards

arhag [11:55 PM]  
Yes, I get that. But it does devalue its use as a influence token does it not? I mean ultimately anyone can still build it (like with sub-chains) or of course on a new chain. But still...

ned 
 [11:56 PM]  
Yes, the influence side of it is granted by the interfaces, though.

arhag [11:56 PM]  
Well, also the only mechanism of distributing rewards on the blockchain currently. (edited)

[11:56]  
That is independent of what the clients choose to display for rankings.

I hope we don't end up gassing like the ETH /ETC chains. Brag all the time about no fee transactions to the locals around me starting to get into digital assets n crypto currencies. :slightly_smiling_face:

ICOs definitely drive short term investment, but you need the smart ICO contract model where you have to buy ETH (STEEM in this case) to pay into the contract for the ICO

ned 
 [11:57 PM]  
I'm not sure devaluing is a way to describe it, especially given how the tokens will compound the attention paid to steem

smooth 
 [11:57 PM]  
longer time i don't really know

[11:57]  
i guess attention cant be bad though

klye 
 [11:57 PM]  
You have an interesting angle on that Ned. I can totally see it though.

ned 
 [11:57 PM]  
smooth, you mean a specific contract for holding the funds during ico?

[11:57]  
thats a great point

[11:57]  
and it should be part of the WP

klye 
 [11:57 PM]  
Even bad press is still advertising.

smooth 
 [11:58 PM]  
thats how most ICOs work on ETH yes

arhag [11:58 PM]  
I mean ultimately I think it is probably the right decision, because it will likely be done eventually somewhere anyway. Might as well have it be done on the Steem chain where STEEM needs to be held to pay for that bandwidth. (edited)

smooth 
 [11:58 PM]  
and the contract handles things like early buyer bonuses, etc.

[11:58]  
so there is an incentive to buy in and lock up ETH earlier
